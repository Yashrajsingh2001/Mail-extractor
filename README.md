# Mail extractor
It is a simple Tkinter application which will find almost all possible Mail address.

Modules used:
    . tkinter 
    . re

When we will run our Mail_Extractor.py file, a Tkinter window will pop up.
You can simply paste the text in the Entry field form which you want to extract mail address and press on Submit button to extract the Mails.

Else you can click on the "Open txt file" button. It will create a .txt file and you can simply paste all the text there and save it.
Then click on the "Get Email" button to get all the mail address.
